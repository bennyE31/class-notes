## Processes
- High level goal:
  - Give each running program the impression it is acting alone
- What changes while a program runs?
  - I/O
    - Files are included
  - CPU
    - registers
  - Memory

## Sharing the CPU
- Time sharing
  - Mechanisms
    - Direct execution
      - Process gets the entire CPU until termination
      - OS cleans up everything afterwards
      - Problems:
        - Security - Giving a process hw access is dangerous
        - Efficiency - Process might do slow IO stuff which bottlenecks the CPU
        - Process could run forever
    - Limited Direct execution
      - Direct execution but CPU supports privilege levels
      - Applications runs in user mode - can only execute certain instructions
      - OS runs in kernel mode - can execute all instructions
      - Switching between modes:
        - Trap - Enters kernel mode from user mode via system call. Privileged operation is executed
        - Timer interrupts
          - Set up by OS at boot
          - Interrupts the CPU every few milliseconds
          - Scheduler might be run on interrupts
        - Threads
          - Lightweight processes
          - Each process can have multiple threads
        - 
  - Policies
