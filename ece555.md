# MOSFETS
- Three operating modes
  - Cutoff (off)
    - Vgs < Vt
  - Linear (on)
    - Vgs >= Vt, Vds < Vgs - Vt
  - Saturation (on)
    - Vgs >= Vt, Vds >= Vgs - Vt
## Long Channel MOSFETS
- Characteristics
    - Gate capacitence
      - Cg = e0 * W * L
    - Drain source current
      - Ids = Qc / t
      - Ids (linear) = un * Cox * (W/L) * [(Vgs - Vt) - (Vds / 2)] * Vds
      - Ids (saturation) = un * Cox * (W/2L) * (Vgs -Vt)^2
    - Charge in channel
      - Cg * (Vgc - Vt)
      - In linear region, Vc ~= (Vs + Vd) / 2
      - Vgc = Vgs - (Vds / 2)
    - Time for charge to cross channel
      - t = L/vn = L / (un * E) = L^2 / (un * Vds)

## Short Channel MOSFETS
- Below micrometer range
- Assumptions made above about Ids are no longer true
- Effects
  - Channel length modulation
    - Effective channel length gets shorter as Vds increases
    - Channel L is reduced by deltL
    - deltL = sqrt(Vds - Vdsat)
    - Current in saturation is now:
      - Ids = un * Cox * (W/2L) * (Vgs - Vt)^2 * (1 + lambda * Vds)
      - lambda = channel modulation factor
      - 1/lambda = early voltage
  - Mobility degradation
    - Electric field attracts carries to edge of surface, lowering mobility
    - ueff = u0 / (1 + n * (Vgs - Vt))
  - Velocity saturation
    - v = (un * E) / (1 + E / Ec) for E < Ec
    - v = vsat for E >= Ec
    - Device might now saturate at Vds > Vdsat
      - Vdsat = Leff vsat / ueff
    - Linear:
      - equation remains the same
    - Saturation:
      - Idsat = vsat * Cox * W * [(Vgs - Vt) - (Vdsat / 2)] * (1 + lambda * Vds)
  - Threshold voltage effects: body effect
    - If Vsb is not 0, the threshold voltage will change
      - As Vsb increases, |Vt| increases for NMOS and PMOS
    - Drain can help by effectively lowering threshold voltage. DIBL effect
  - Leakage: sub-threshold current and gate leakage
  - Temperature effects
