# ECE537: Communication Networks
## Client-Server
**Structure:**
<br>
Client <--> Router <--> ISP <--> Backbone network <--> Server

## Network Switching
- Circuit Switching
    - Physically change path between endpoints (first manually, eventually automatically)
    - Pros:
        - Dedicated Connections
        - Less interruption
        - Continuous Access to entire resource
    - Cons:
      - Not scalable (expensive)
      - Resource allocation delay
      - Time inefficient
      - Fairness in resource allocation
- Packet Switching
  - Send network and hope it gets to the destination
  - Best effort service
  - Each node acts as new source
  - Sender packetizes data and sends packets individually
  - Packets contain:
    - Who is sending
    - Final destination
    - Who to send to next
  - Pros:
    - No resource allocation
    - Maximize efficiency of network
    - Scalable
  - Cons:
    - Many delays since resources are preallocated
  - Performance metrics
    - Throughput 
    - Delay
  - Routing vs Forwarding
    - Routing - what node is next
    - Forwarding - through which port am i sending the packet

## Delays
  - Types of delay
    - Processing delay
      - Routers speed to take in, route, and forward a packet
      - Only dependent on router
    - Propogation delay
      - Speed at which the physical medium can transport data
      - Distance between endpoints
    - Transmission time
      - Output rate of router
      - Length of packet
    - Queuing delay
      - Time spent in buffer
      - Determined by input and output rate of router as well as the size of the buffer

## Throughput
  - Instantaneous throughput
    - Throughput at given time
  - Average throughput
    - Average throughput across period of time

## Protocol Architecture
  - 5 Layers of networking protocols
    - Application
    - Transport
    - Network
    - Link
    - Physical
  - Application
    - Packetizes message
  - Transport
    - Adds header to packet with info on how to send packet
  - Network
    - Adds header with network protocol info (ip and stuff)
  - Link
    - Adds link header with info to avoid collisions
  - Physical
    - Adds physical header with info to use medium

## Application Layer Protocol
  - HTTP, DNS, Mail Service
  - HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
    - Each conversation starts with a request from client
    - Server then responds
    - Persistant or non-persistant
  - DNS - Domain name service
    - How we get ip address from URL
    - Not terrible if packets is lost - uses unreliable transport layer
    - Uses UDP
    - Still needs to know server IP and port# (usually 53)
    - Architecture:
      - Cannot be centralized
      - 13 root servers in the world
      - TLD (top level domain servers) 
        - last three letters (.edu, .com, .gov)
      - Authoratative servers
        - UsSually where the site is hosted
    - Iterative querying
      - Client requests each level of hierarchy to get ip address
    - Recursive querying
      - Query flows directly from client through hierarchy and back to client
